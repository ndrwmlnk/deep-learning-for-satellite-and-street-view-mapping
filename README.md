| Figure 3. Architecture overview. A front-end ResNet feature extractor generates image-based features, which are mapped to an orthographic representation via our proposed orthographic feature transform. The topdown network processes these features in the birds-eye-view space and at each location on the ground plane predicts a confidence score S, a position offset ∆pos, a dimension offset ∆dim and an angle vector ∆ang. |

| Fig. 1: The 3D vehicle detection problem is transformed to a 2D detection problem in warped bird’s eye view (BEV) images. The orange lines attached to each orange boxes are tails, defined in Sec. III-C.1 and Fig. 5, which are regressed by the network to better handle distortions in BEV images. |
